# Code for Training and Linear Probing Vision Transformer

Python code to reproduce ViT results presented in the paper What Variables Affect Out-Of-Distribution Generalization in Pretrained Models?

The code requires the timm package.

To use the code, simply run the following:

- To train ViTs on ID datasets: `pretrain_vit.sh`

- To perform linear probing on ID and OOD datasets: `train_lp.sh`

To get results for other configures, change the relevant arguments.
